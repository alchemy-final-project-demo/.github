# Ripe Banana (Alchemy Final Project Demo)

Ripe Banana offers both professional and crowd sourced reviews of films. See
ratings, who starred in what, and what studios produced the films.

## Project Description

Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. But
not anymore! Dulce Detector uses a powerful machine learning algorithm to
accurately predict what exact chocolates are in the box.

Dulce Detector provides an interface for describing your chocolates via shapes,
frosting, decorations, sprinkles, etc. From there, the machine learning
algorithm kicks in and determines the exact flavors and fillings of the
chocolates.
